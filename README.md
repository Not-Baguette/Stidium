# Stidium

## Description
Python based ransomware that uses Symmetric key encryption (AES), Believe it or not I made the first version under 24 hours (So expect the code to be messy). It has stuff like a normal ransomware do, a list of encrypted files, the amount, the btc address to pay, decryptor, and it saves even after restart (Also smtplib will show the user static IP by opening gmail, scrolling down to the bottom, and click `details` on the bottom right [below `Last account activity: ... minute`]). This code is tested per piece so I am not sure if it works but theoritically it should. **This version is still in early stages of testing.**

`main.py` might be out of date compared to `main - development.py`, this is not because I forgot about it. It is just me still trying to find a reason to do a 5 min work that I could do right now instead of postponing it. (P.S. Just remove most `"""` and some `#` at the end you'd be good to go)
CURRENT STATUS: **main.py is not outdated**

This project is for educational purposes only to show how would a ransomware possibly work and encrypt your data

## TODO (Finish it all before actually releasing v1.0.0-beta)
- [ ] Test it on a VM
- [X] fix it so it doesnt quit before decrypting all files
- [x] Fix first run issue
- [X] Check if the amount of files are actually real later
- [X] Fix the grammar error on the label
- [X] Make several U+200b as the name incase the user uses `taskkill /f` (doesn't decrypt the files though)
- [X] Stops all running programs that are not essential
- [X] Adding a safeguard feature

### TODO (Before v1.1.0-beta)
- [ ] Finish up `post-infect` function that infects it with [Project Gideon](https://github.com/Not-Baguette/Project-Gideon/)
- [ ] Switch to `Twofish` or `Blowfish` Algorithm.
- [ ] Make it so that even if the user stops the process of nuking, once reopened it will just continue


## Preview

## Dependencies
- tkinter (for the ransomware demand screen)
- cryptography (To encrypt and decrypt)

## Installation
TBD
### For developers
- Get 2 burner emails
- Put it on `SENDER` and `RECEIVER` variable on the top

- Get an app password for the `SENDER` email
- Install dependencies modules
- remove the commented out encryptor, decryptor, and find_file function alongside the function call on the bottom for inserting to startup and sending via email (I heavily advice against removing the commented out tkinter attributes and configs)
- Change the BTC address to your own (Unnecessary if you just want a preview)

## More information (Nice to know basis)
- `file header encryptor & decryptor.py` is another way to encrypt a file, instead of encrypting the whole file, it encrypts just the header.

- This uses `AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)` algorithm to encrypt but I suggest you look at other algs like `RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)`, `Blowfish`, `Twofish`, `3DES (Triple DES)`, `Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)`, and `Serpent`. I might consider to move to Blowfish or Twofish for it's speed but we'll see. P.S. `ECC`, `3DES`, `Serpent` and `RSA` is most likely slower than `AES/Blowfish/Twofish` but some definitely have better security.
