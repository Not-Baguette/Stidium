# Tests

## Description
This folder is filled with comparisons between other algorithms, this can differentiate wildly depending on the PC too. Make sure they have their own folder else tons of `txt` files will appear on the directory

## How to use
Open up `generator.py` and change `range(1000):` to any number you want `e.g. range(10):` will output 10 files on *current directory*, so make sure to put it on a folder for itself (It also will encrypt and decrypt any other `txt` files on that directory if you have). After that, open up a comparator to compare both algs.

## Results
These results are *relative*, they are just for documentation purposes only.

### AES vs Blowfish
100,000 files - 1248 bytes each
TBD
